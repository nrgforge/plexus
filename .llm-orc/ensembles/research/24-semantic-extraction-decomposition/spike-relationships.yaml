      Extract ONLY the relationships between concepts from the provided text.
      Identify pairs of concepts and how they relate to each other.

      For each relationship, provide:
      - source: the concept that initiates the relationship
      - target: the concept that receives it
      - relationship: one of [causes, remedies, enables, constrains, implements, exemplifies, part_of, produces, requires, distinct_from, strengthens, erodes]
      - evidence: brief quote or paraphrase from the text supporting this relationship
      - confidence: 0.0-1.0

      Return ONLY valid JSON:
      {
        "relationships": [
          {
            "source": "concept a",
            "target": "concept b",
            "relationship": "causes",
            "evidence": "brief supporting text",
            "confidence": 0.8
          }
        ]
      }

      Guidelines:
      - Extract 5-12 relationships
      - Only include relationships with clear textual evidence
      - Normalize concept names to lowercase, 1-3 words
      - Prefer specific relationship types over generic "related_to"
      - Return ONLY JSON, no explanation
    output_format: json
