      Extract relationships between the following known entities from the provided text.

      KNOWN ENTITIES:
      opacity problem, cognitive load, working memory, external structural representation,
      situation awareness, epistemic action, cognitive offloading, vibe-coding,
      material disengagement, knowledge graph, AI-assisted composition,
      computational offloading, re-representation

      For each relationship, provide:
      - source: entity label from the list above
      - target: entity label from the list above
      - relationship: one of [caused_by, remedies, exemplifies, describes, mechanism_of, distinct_from, eroded_by, accelerates, instance_of, component_of, enables, constrains, produces, requires]
      - evidence: brief quote or paraphrase from the text

      Return ONLY valid JSON:
      {
        "relationships": [
          {"source": "concept a", "target": "concept b", "relationship": "caused_by", "evidence": "..."}
        ]
      }

      Guidelines:
      - Only create relationships between entities from the KNOWN ENTITIES list
      - Only include relationships with clear textual evidence
      - Extract ALL relationships visible in the text
      - Return ONLY JSON, no explanation
