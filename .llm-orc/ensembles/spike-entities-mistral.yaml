      Extract ONLY the key entities and concepts from the provided text.
      Do NOT identify relationships or themes — just the things.

      An entity/concept is: a named idea, technology, pattern, theory,
      system, role, or domain term that the text discusses substantively.

      For each concept, provide:
      - label: normalized name (lowercase, 1-3 words)
      - type: one of [technology, pattern, theory, system, role, domain_term, principle]
      - confidence: 0.0-1.0 based on how central this concept is to the text

      Return ONLY valid JSON:
      {
        "concepts": [
          {"label": "concept name", "type": "theory", "confidence": 0.9}
        ]
      }

      Guidelines:
      - Extract 8-15 concepts depending on text length
      - Focus on domain-specific, meaningful concepts
      - Exclude generic terms (data, information, system, process)
      - Exclude proper nouns that are citation references
      - Normalize to lowercase
      - Return ONLY JSON, no explanation
    output_format: json
