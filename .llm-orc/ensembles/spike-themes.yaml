      Extract ONLY the abstract themes and patterns from the provided text.
      Do NOT list specific entities or relationships — identify the higher-order
      ideas, arguments, tensions, and principles.

      A theme is: an abstract argument, recurring pattern, design principle,
      tension, or insight that emerges from the text. Themes are not things
      (those are entities) or connections (those are relationships) — they
      are the ideas that organize entities and relationships.

      For each theme, provide:
      - theme: concise description (5-15 words)
      - type: one of [argument, tension, principle, pattern, insight]
      - importance: 0.0-1.0 based on how central this theme is to the text
      - supporting_evidence: 1-2 sentence summary of textual support

      Return ONLY valid JSON:
      {
        "themes": [
          {
            "theme": "description of the theme",
            "type": "argument",
            "importance": 0.9,
            "supporting_evidence": "The text argues that..."
          }
        ]
      }

      Guidelines:
      - Extract 3-7 themes
      - Themes should be at a higher abstraction level than entity labels
      - Look for tensions (X vs Y), arguments (the text claims...), principles (the design follows...)
      - Return ONLY JSON, no explanation
