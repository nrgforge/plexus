First, I need to go through each section of the text and look for mentions of the known entities.\n\nStarting with the problem section: \"opacity problem\" is introduced as the main issue. The text says that the problem is structural, so maybe \"opacity problem\" is related to \"external structural representation\" as a remedy. The remedy section mentions that the solution is external structural representations, so that's a \"remedies\" relationship.\n\nNext, the cognitive mechanism part talks about working memory and cognitive load. Sweller's theory is mentioned, which relates to cognitive load. So \"working memory\" might be connected to \"cognitive load\" through \"mechanism_of\" or \"caused_by\". The text says that when information isn't organized, it imposes extraneous cognitive load, so maybe \"cognitive load\" is caused by \"working memory\" limitations. Wait, no, the mechanism is that working memory's limits cause cognitive load. So \"working memory\" is the source, \"cognitive load\" is the target, and the relationship is \"mechanism_of\".\n\nThen, the opacity problem is described as caused by the lack of external structural representations. The text says the problem is structural, so \"opacity problem\" is caused by the absence of \"external structural representation\". But the remedy is to use external structural representations, so maybe \"external structural representation\" remedies \"opacity problem\".\n\nIn the AI section, \"vibe-coding\" is mentioned as a practice leading to material disengagement. So \"vibe-coding\" might be an instance of \"material disengagement\". The text says Cito and Bork describe it as material disengagement, so that's an \"instance_of\" relationship.\n\nThe remedy section also mentions \"epistemic action\" and \"external structural representation\". Endsley's situation awareness is eroded by the opacity problem. So \"opacity problem\" erodes \"situation awareness\". The text says that situation awareness erodes in information-dense composition, which is the opacity problem.\n\nThen, the part about computational offloading and re-representation. Scaife and Rogers identify computational offloading, re-representation, and graphical constraining. So \"external structural representation\" might be an instance of \"computational offloading\" or \"re-representation\". The text says external structural representations are epistemic actions, which are different from pragmatic actions. But computational offloading is one of the mechanisms, so maybe \"external structural representation\" is an instance of \"computational offloading\".\n\nAlso, \"external structural representation\" enables \"situation awareness\" because it provides ongoing awareness. The text mentions that a live structural representation could provide ongoing situation awareness.\n\nThe caveat section talks about cognitive offloading. Gerlich's study shows that cognitive offloading (which is a type of epistemic action) has a negative correlation with critical thinking. So \"cognitive offloading\" might be a type of \"epistemic action\", but the text says that epistemic actions are different from pragmatic ones. Wait, the text says that external structural representations are epistemic actions. So maybe \"epistemic action\" is a broader category, and \"computational offloading\" is a specific type. But the user's list includes \"cognitive offloading\" and \"epistemic action\" as separate entities. The text mentions \"cognitive offloading\" as a term used by Gerlich, so maybe \"cognitive offloading\" is a type of \"epistemic action\"? Or is it a separate concept? The text says that Kirsh and Maglio distinguish epistemic actions (changing the agent's computational state) from pragmatic actions. So \"cognitive offloading\" might be an instance of \"epistemic action\".\n\nAlso, the text says that external structural representations are epistemic actions. So \"external structural representation\" is an instance of \"epistemic action\".\n\nIn the open questions, \"knowledge graph\" is mentioned as a possible form of representation. So \"knowledge graph\" is an instance of \"external structural representation\".\n\nPutting this all together, I need to list all these relationships with sources, targets, relationships, and evidence from the text.\n"},"done":true,"done_reason":"stop","total_duration":125416576833,"load_duration":3211571208,"prompt_eval_count":1234,"prompt_eval_duration":9362406750,"eval_count":1379,"eval_duration":112460130371}
