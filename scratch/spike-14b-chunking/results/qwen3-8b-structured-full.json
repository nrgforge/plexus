The user wants me to extract relationships between the known entities from the provided text. The entities are: opacity problem, cognitive load, working memory, external structural representation, situation awareness, epistemic action, cognitive offloading, vibe-coding, material disengagement, knowledge graph, AI-assisted composition, computational offloading, re-representation.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the text carefully and identify where these entities are mentioned and how they relate to each other. Let me start by going through each section of the text.\n\nIn the \"The Problem\" section, the opacity problem is introduced as the main issue where knowledge exists but isn't perceptible. The text mentions that the problem is structural, not storage-related. It connects to the idea that the structure is in the artifact but not in the creator's head. That might relate to working memory and cognitive load.\n\nMoving to \"The Cognitive Mechanism,\" it talks about Sweller's cognitive load theory, which is about working memory limitations. The text says that when information density outpaces comprehension, the excess becomes invisible. This seems to link cognitive load and working memory to the opacity problem. Also, Kirschner et al. mention distributing load across collaborators, time, or external representations. Since the opacity problem occurs when none of these are available, that connects to external structural representations as a solution.\n\nIn \"AI Makes It Acute,\" vibe-coding is discussed as a scenario where developers use AI without fully understanding the code. This relates to material disengagement. The interaction pattern with AI adds interruptions, which ties into cognitive load and Mark et al.'s work on interrupted work. Also, AI-assisted composition is mentioned as part of the problem.\n\nThe \"Why Better Prompting Won't Fix It\" section states that even with better AI interaction, the problem remains because the structure exceeds working memory capacity. So, the opacity problem is about information density, not interaction quality. This reinforces the link between cognitive load, working memory, and the opacity problem.\n\nIn \"The Remedy: External Structural Representations,\" the solution is presented as external structural representations. Endsley's situation awareness is mentioned as eroding in information-dense composition. The text connects external structural representations to epistemic actions (Kirsh and Maglio), which are actions that make mental computation easier. Also, Scaife and Rogers' mechanisms: computational offloading, re-representation, and graphical constraining are discussed. Larkin and Simon's work on diagrams reducing cognitive load is another point. So, external structural representations are linked to computational offloading, re-representation, and situation awareness. Also, the text mentions that these representations are epistemic actions, which ties into the cognitive mechanisms.\n\nThe \"A Caveat on Cognitive Offloading\" section warns that cognitive offloading might reduce critical thinking, as per Gerlich and Klein and Klein's extended hollowed mind. However, a structural tool that externalizes awareness while preserving interpretation might avoid this. This connects cognitive offloading to the critique of tools that outsource reasoning, and the knowledge graph as a way to show connections.\n\nNow, I need to map these relationships. Let's list possible relationships:\n\n1. Opacity problem is caused by cognitive load and working memory limitations. Evidence from Sweller's theory and the text's explanation of information density exceeding comprehension.\n\n2. Opacity problem is related to material disengagement (vibe-coding) as developers don't comprehend the generated code. Evidence from Cito and Bork's description.\n\n3. Cognitive load is linked to working memory via Sweller's theory. The text states that information not organized into schemas imposes extraneous cognitive load on working memory.\n\n4. External structural representations are a solution to the opacity problem. Evidence from the remedy section where they are presented as the necessary structural solution.\n\n5. External structural representations relate to situation awareness (Endsley's definition) as the erosion of situation awareness is part of the problem. The text says that situation awareness erodes in information-dense composition.\n\n6. External structural representations are epistemic actions (Kirsh and Maglio). The text states that an external structural representation is epistemic.\n\n7. Computational offloading is a mechanism of external structural representations (Scaife and Rogers). The text mentions computational offloading as one of the three mechanisms.\n\n8. Re-representation is another mechanism of external structural representations. The text lists re-representation as one of the three mechanisms.\n\n9. External structural representations reduce cognitive load (Larkin and Simon's diagrams reducing cognitive load). The text cites this as evidence.\n\n10. Cognitive offloading is linked to the critique of tools that outsource reasoning (Gerlich and Klein and Klein). The text mentions that frequent AI tool usage correlates with reduced critical thinking via cognitive offloading.\n\n11. Knowledge graph is mentioned as a way to show connections (three fragments sharing a concept). The text's example of the graph shows this.\n\nWait, the knowledge graph is part of the entities. The text says \"the graph shows that three fragments share a concept; the creator decides whether that matters.\" So knowledge graph is an example of an external structural representation. Therefore, knowledge graph is a type of external structural representation. But the user wants relationships between the known entities, so knowledge graph would be a target for external structural representation as a type. But the user's known entities include knowledge graph as a separate entity. So maybe knowledge graph is an instance of external structural representation. But the user's instruction says to create relationships between entities from the list. So perhaps knowledge graph is a type of external structural representation. But the text doesn't explicitly say that. It just mentions a graph as an example. So maybe the relationship is that knowledge graph is an example of external structural representation. But the user's known entities include both, so perhaps the relationship is that knowledge graph is a form of external structural representation. However, the text doesn't explicitly state that. It's possible that the user expects that knowledge graph is a type of external structural representation. Alternatively, maybe the knowledge graph is part of the solution, so the relationship is that knowledge graph is an external structural representation. But the text doesn't explicitly say that. The text says \"the graph shows...\" which might refer to a knowledge graph. So perhaps the relationship is that knowledge graph is an external structural representation. But I need to check if that's supported by the text. The text mentions \"the graph\" as an example of an external structural representation. So maybe the knowledge graph is an example of external structural representation. Therefore, the relationship would be knowledge graph is a type of external structural representation. But the user's known entities include both, so that's a possible relationship.\n\nAlso, the text mentions that the remedy is external structural representations, which could include a knowledge graph. So the relationship between knowledge graph and external structural representation would be that knowledge graph is an instance of external structural representation. But the text doesn't explicitly state that. It's possible that the user expects that, but I need to be careful. Alternatively, maybe the knowledge graph is a separate entity, and the text doesn't directly link them. So perhaps that's not a valid relationship unless the text explicitly connects them.\n\nLet me check the text again. The last paragraph says: \"The graph shows that three fragments share a concept; the creator decides whether that matters.\" The graph here is an example of an external structural representation. So the knowledge graph is an example of an external structural representation. Therefore, the relationship would be knowledge graph is a type of external structural representation. But the user's known entities include both, so that's a valid relationship.\n\nSo, compiling all these, the relationships would be:\n\n- Opacity problem is caused by cognitive load and working memory limitations (from Sweller's theory and the text's explanation of information density exceeding comprehension).\n\n- Opacity problem is related to material disengagement (vibe-coding) as developers don't comprehend the generated code (Cito and Bork).\n\n- Cognitive load is linked to working memory via Sweller's theory (information not organized into schemas imposes extraneous cognitive load on working memory).\n\n- External structural representations are a solution to the opacity problem (remedy section).\n\n- External structural representations relate to situation awareness (Endsley's definition) as the erosion of situation awareness is part of the problem.\n\n- External structural representations are epistemic actions (Kirsh and Maglio).\n\n- Computational offloading is a mechanism of external structural representations (Scaife and Rogers).\n\n- Re-representation is another mechanism of external structural representations (Scaife and Rogers).\n\n- External structural representations reduce cognitive load (Larkin and Simon's diagrams reducing cognitive load).\n\n- Cognitive offloading is linked to the critique of tools that outsource reasoning (Gerlich and Klein and Klein).\n\n- Knowledge graph is an example of an external structural representation (the graph in the text).\n\nWait, but the user's known entities include \"knowledge graph\" as a separate entity. The text mentions a graph (which could be a knowledge graph) as an example of an external structural representation. So the relationship would be knowledge graph is a type of external structural representation. But the text doesn't explicitly say that. It's possible that the user expects that, but I need to be precise. The text says \"the graph shows...\" which is an example of an external structural representation. Therefore, the knowledge graph is an instance of external structural representation. So the relationship would be knowledge graph is a type of external structural representation.\n\nBut the user's known entities include both, so that's a valid relationship.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that all relationships are between the known entities and have clear textual evidence. Let me list each relationship with source, target, type, and evidence.\n"},"done":true,"done_reason":"stop","total_duration":147017150333,"load_duration":3019206583,"prompt_eval_count":3049,"prompt_eval_duration":8461572792,"eval_count":780,"eval_duration":37920820791}
