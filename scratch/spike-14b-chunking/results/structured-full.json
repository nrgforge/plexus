The user wants me to extract relationships between specific known entities from the given text. The entities are listed, so I need to make sure I only use those. First, I'll read through the text carefully to identify where these entities are mentioned and how they relate to each other.\n\nStarting with the problem section: \"opacity problem\" is introduced as the main issue. The text mentions that the problem is structural, not a storage one. Then, in the cognitive mechanism section, it talks about working memory and cognitive load theory by Sweller. So, \"opacity problem\" is related to \"cognitive load\" and \"working memory\" through the explanation that when information is too dense, it creates extraneous load.\n\nNext, the text mentions \"external structural representation\" as a remedy. Endsley's situation awareness is linked here because the erosion of situation awareness is part of the problem. So, \"external structural representation\" might be connected to \"situation awareness\" as a solution.\n\nLooking at the AI section, \"vibe-coding\" is mentioned in the context of developers not understanding the code they generate. The text also brings up \"material disengagement\" by Cito and Bork, so \"vibe-coding\" and \"material disengagement\" are related.\n\nIn the remedy section, \"external structural representation\" is connected to \"computational offloading\" and \"re-representation\" from Scaife and Rogers. Also, \"knowledge graph\" is mentioned as a possible form of external representation, so \"external structural representation\" and \"knowledge graph\" might be related.\n\nThe caveat on cognitive offloading mentions \"cognitive offloading\" and \"epistemic action\" since the text refers to external representations as epistemic actions. Also, \"computational offloading\" is a type of offloading, so that's a relationship.\n\nI need to make sure each relationship is between the known entities and has clear evidence from the text. Let me go through each entity and see their connections:\n\n- Opacity problem: linked to cognitive load, working memory, situation awareness, external structural representation, material disengagement, vibe-coding, AI-assisted composition.\n- Cognitive load: linked to working memory, opacity problem, external structural representation.\n- Working memory: linked to cognitive load, opacity problem.\n- External structural representation: linked to situation awareness, computational offloading, re-representation, knowledge graph, epistemic action, opacity problem.\n- Situation awareness: linked to external structural representation, opacity problem.\n- Epistemic action: linked to external structural representation.\n- Cognitive offloading: linked to external structural representation, material disengagement.\n- Vibe-coding: linked to material disengagement, opacity problem.\n- Material disengagement: linked to vibe-coding, cognitive offloading.\n- Knowledge graph: linked to external structural representation.\n- AI-assisted composition: linked to opacity problem, vibe-coding.\n- Computational offloading: linked to external structural representation, cognitive offloading.\n- Re-representation: linked to external structural representation.\n\nNow, I need to check each of these for textual evidence. For example, the text says \"external structural representation is epistemic,\" so that's a direct link between external structural representation and epistemic action. Also, \"computational offloading\" is mentioned as one of the mechanisms by Scaife and Rogers, so that's a relationship between external structural representation and computational offloading.\n\nI should ensure that each relationship is clearly supported by the text and that I'm not making assumptions. Let me go through each possible pair again and confirm the evidence.\n"},"done":true,"done_reason":"stop","total_duration":149080764000,"load_duration":6121880584,"prompt_eval_count":1803,"prompt_eval_duration":5912447625,"eval_count":846,"eval_duration":67048175257}
